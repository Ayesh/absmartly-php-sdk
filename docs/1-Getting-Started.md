# Getting Started

## Install the SDK

Once your Web Console is setup and you have created some experiments, you can install our SDKs through your package manager, a CDN or by directly importing it.

> **Compatibility**
> The A/B Smartly PHP SDK is compatible with PHP versions 7.4, 8.0, and later. It takes advantage of modern PHP features
> when they are available (such as built-in MurMurHash on PHP 8.1+). The SDK is thoroughly tested on PHP development branch
> as well, and it is recommended to use the latest PHP version possible.
> 
> ** Requirements**
> - PHP ^7.4.0 || ^8.0.0
> - Curl Extension

**Install using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)

To install A/B Smartly PHP SDK using Composer, run the following command:

```bash
composer require absmartly/php-sdk

## Import and Initialize SDK

Once the SDK is installed, it can be initialized in your project.
